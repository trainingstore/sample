          A <span style="font-style: normal; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">
          book</span> is a series of pages assembled for easy portability and reading,
          as well as the composition contained in it.
          The most common modern form of book is a codex volume consisting of
          rectangular paper pages bound on one side, with a heavier cover
          and spine, so that it can fan open for reading.
          Books have taken other forms, such as scrolls, leaves on a string,
          or strips tied together; and the pages have been of parchment,
          vellum, papyrus, bamboo slips, palm leaves, silk, wood,
          and other materials.
